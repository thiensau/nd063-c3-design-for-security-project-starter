Security Hub - A finding is a security issue or failed security check.

- Hardware MFA should be enabled for the root user
- MFA should be enabled for the root user
- Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk - WebAppSG
- Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk - AttackInstanceSG

Recommendations
- Enable MFA for root account
- Update security group to allow only ports that needed

AWS config - A lot of Noncompliant rule(s) & Noncompliant resource(s) - I only listed a few rules in here
- Checks whether the active access keys are rotated within the number of days specified in maxAccessKeyAge
- Checks whether HTTP to HTTPS redirection is configured on all HTTP listeners of Application Load Balancers. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if one or more HTTP listeners of Application Load Balancers do not have HTTP to HTTPS redirection configured.
- Checks whether Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances have a public IP association. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if the publicIp field is present in the Amazon EC2 instance configuration item. This rule applies only to IPv4.
- Checks if an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Origin type has origin access control (OAC) enabled. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT for CloudFront distributions with Amazon S3 origins that don't have OAC enabled.

Recommendations:
- Config number of days the active access keys are rotated for maxAccessKeyAge
- Reconfig Application Load Balancers HTTP & HTTPS listeners
- Reconfig EC2 instance to remove public IP config
- Disbale OAC Amazon CloudFront
