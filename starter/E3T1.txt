Here are some of the key ways in which Amazon GuardDuty can help you monitor, detect, and manage potential threats in your AWS environment.

Continuously monitors specific data sources and event logs
Foundational threat detection 
â€“ When you enable GuardDuty in an AWS account, GuardDuty automatically starts ingesting the foundational data sources associated with that account. 
These data sources include AWS CloudTrail management events, VPC flow logs (from Amazon EC2 instances), and DNS logs. 
You don't need to enable anything else for GuardDuty to start analyzing and processing these data sources to generate associated security findings.
